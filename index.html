        <h1>Drag from <a href="https://github.com/hugo3m/drag" target="_blank">hugo3m</a></h1>
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Drag is an open source project showing the mathematics behind dragging an object in a 3D environment. When
            holding your cursor on an axis, the following happens:
        <ul>
            <li>A vector <b>Vinit</b> is created with the direction from the camera to the intersection from the raycast
                from the
                camera to the cursor.</li>
            <li>From this vector, a plane is created using, as a normal, one of the two vectors normal to the one being
                dragged. <i>If you choose to drag the vector <b>right</b>, the vector used as a normal for the plane
                    will either be <b>top</b> or <b>front</b>.</i> The vector which has the lowest angle with
                <b>Vinit</b> is chosen. <i>It ensures that the plane will morelikely face the camera.</i>
            </li>
            <li>The scene displays a plane with the color of the normal vector. The plane is used as a surface to
                interesect with the raycast from the camera to your cursor when moving your cursor around. The result of
                the intersection is a yellow sphere, following your cursor within the plane.
            </li>
            <li>The final step is to project the intersection on the dragged axis and change the position according to
                the distance from the initial dragged. The result of the projection is a sphere of the color of the
                dragged axis.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Todo:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Rotation of the cube.</li>
            <li>Dragging along a plane.</li>
            <li>Dragging from the root.</li>
        </ul>
